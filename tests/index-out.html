        <p>She was Lola in slacks. She was Dolly at school. She was Do­lores on the dot­ted line. But in my arms she was al­ways Lolita. Did she have a pre­cur­sor? She did, in­deed she did. In point of fact, there might have been no Lolita at all had I not loved, one sum­mer, an ini­tial girl-child. In a prince­dom by the sea. Oh when? About as many years be­fore Lolita was born as my age was that sum­mer. You can al­ways count on a mur­derer for a fancy prose style. Ladies and gen­tle­men of the jury, ex­hibit num­ber one is what the ser­aphs, the mis­in­formed, sim­ple, no­ble-winged ser­aphs, en­vied. Look at this tan­gle of thorns.</p>
